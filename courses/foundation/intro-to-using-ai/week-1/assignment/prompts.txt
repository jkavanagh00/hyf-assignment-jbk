I would like to make a simple HTML page that introduces me and my interests.
Begin by creating an HTML document and adding a heading with the text "About Me" at the top.

Add a short introduction as a paragraph element below the heading.

Add an unordered list of my interests (juggling, games, programming).

Centre the heading.

Change the font to a custom font.

Add a background colour.

Add a "fun" button somewhere on the page which changes the background colour to a random colour when clicked.

Make this page responsive, using media queries to style the page for mobile and desktop size screens.
